# HTML & CSS Beginner Projects

Welcome to my HTML and CSS beginner-friendly projects repository! Here, I will be sharing the projects I'm practicing as part of my learning journey, inspired by various YouTube tutorials and courses.

## About This Repository

This repository serves as a place for me to document my progress, showcase my work, and practice my HTML and CSS skills. Each project will be organized into its own folder, and I will continuously add new projects as I learn and create them.

Feel free to explore the projects, use the code as a reference, and provide feedback or suggestions. If you're a fellow learner, I hope these projects help you on your journey to becoming proficient in web development!
